# Guess-Game

This script is an interactive guessing game, which will ask the user to guess a number between 1 and 99.

We are using the random module with the randint function to get a random number. The script also contains a while loop, which make the script run until the user guess the right number.

To play the game clone the repo and play the game by using python guessgame.py

Keep Coding !
